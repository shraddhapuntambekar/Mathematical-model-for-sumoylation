Assumptions of the sumoylation model
- Modification of the targets is modeled as independent of E3.
- Detailed activation involving ATP usage was not considered
- Different isoforms of SUMO and SENP are not considered.
- Single site modification of the targets is considered.
- Model does not distinguish between sumoylation of multiple lysines on a single target and poly-sumoylation at the single lysine on a modified target
